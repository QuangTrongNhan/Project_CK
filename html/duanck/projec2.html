        <p>The warm autumn sun streamed in through the windows, casting a soft glow on the interiors of the hospice. A deep, alluring peace and stillness radiated in the place. Home of the Dying, it was called, paradoxically, there was much life to be found here.

            With background music playing boisterously, there was an old lady who caught my eye. Gingerly, I moved towards her, knelt down and helped her with applying some oil and rubbing it on her legs.
            
            She was staring into space.
            Her expression emotionless.
            Her left eye was frozen – bloodshot.
            And her right eye was wet with tears.
            She spoke no English. And I no Bengali.
            
            In that moment, a scene from the movie The Passion of the Christ flashed in my mind’s eye. I glimpsed the face of Jesus, bruised, beaten and bloodied for our sake. The one with Jesus hanging on the cross at His crucifixion.</p>
